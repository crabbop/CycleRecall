A learning tool for Andoid Netrunner cards.
I have very limited skill in the area of web design or netrunner.

A website for rote learning Netrunner cards. 
Displays a card, with some or all data obfuscated. 
The user would be presented with either multiple choice options or a fill in box to guess/remember/learn the hidden data. 
Hidden components would likely be limited to cost and name initially, before adding other data points like strength, faction, abilities and identities. 
Initially limited to Startup format.
Utilise the Netrunner DB API.

Long term, open to standard format also.
?Make public if looks/ works nicely.
Utilise memorisation principles on how often a card is presented to you before and after you start to guess it correctly. 
Select a grouping of cards you would like to learn, eg NBN ICE or Ararch programs. 
Probably stop using the API and host card data locally.
